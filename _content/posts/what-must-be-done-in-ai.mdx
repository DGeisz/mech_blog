Hello, my friend! At the present moment, I find myself ferociously compelled to pursue several different lines of research with respect to AI (specifically Generative AI). The purpose of this post is to  explain why these particular areas of research are compelling to me given the current landscape of AI.

\[TODO: Write the rest of this\]

# Where are we right now?

(Feel free to skip this if you’re in AI. Not much new here)

## ChatGPT

Ok, so what’s the state of AI at the moment? Well, OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT lit a metaphorical fire under the asses of basically everyone in SF/Silicon Valley, and got everyone super duper hyped about LLMs (and eventually large multi-modal models). However, after messing around with GPT-4 for a couple of weeks, you pretty quickly realize that:

1. GPT knows a lot of things about basically everything. Not surprising given that it’s trained on the internet.
2. …it’s not actually that smart.

Specifically, if you throw hard math or programming problems at GPT-4, it’ll start fucking up pretty quickly. Ok, there’s really no new information here, let’s move on.

## What’s everyone working on?

### Foundation Model People

Right now, you have a bunch of companies that are actually training foundation models like GPT-4. These are well-resourced companies like DeepMind, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Cohere, and a bunch of much smaller companies that have managed to get their hands on hundreds of millions of dollars. Basically these companies have been killing themselves to produce models that are competitive with GPT-4.  And some models like Claude or Gemini have accomplished this.  Great, who’s next?

### GPT Wrappers

There are a bunch of start-ups that are essentially building products that apply GPT-4 (and other analogous models) to different domains.  Whether it’s Cursor building
